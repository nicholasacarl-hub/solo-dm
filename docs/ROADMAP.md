# Roadmap

Ideas for after v0.1, roughly in order of how much they'd improve play. Each is a good size for one
vibe-coding session.

## Play experience

- **Party play**: a DM-run companion with its own sheet in the combat tracker, or a second player
  character the player controls.
- **Voice**: optional text-to-speech for narration and voice input for the composer.
- **Downtime and Bastions** (2024 DMG concepts, from the player's imported books): between-session
  activities the DM resolves with tools.
- **Session-zero chat**: a guided conversation that builds the character and campaign premise with the
  DM, as an alternative to the builder form.

## Rules depth

- **Spell effects**: concentration tracking on combatants, durations that tick down by round, and
  spell-based AC (Mage Armor, Shield of Faith).
- **Class extras**: Unarmored Movement, lineage spells gained at levels 3 and 5, and replacing
  "Action Surge (two uses)" / "Indomitable" entries in place at Fighter 13 and 17.
- **Level-up spell picks**: choosing new spells in the level-up dialog (ASI/feat, Epic Boon and Fighting
  Style choices and subclass catch-up are in), plus multiclass proficiency gains and features that pick
  more than one option.

## Memory and cost

- **Chronicle condensing**: summarize the oldest session recaps into chapters once the chronicle gets
  long, so the system prompt stays compact over very long campaigns.
- **Cache keep-alive**: an optional low-cost keep-alive for long pauses, instead of the 1-hour cache
  TTL, with a cost comparison in Settings.
- **Usage dashboard**: per-session and per-campaign token/cost history from the stored usage totals.

## Platform

- **Offline/PWA**: a service worker so the app (and demo mode) works offline; installable on phones.
- **More sync targets**: an export to Google Drive or a GitHub Gist alongside the private-repo sync.
- **End-to-end tests in CI**: run `e2e/` (demo flow + fake-API flow) on pull requests.

## Battle map follow-ups

The first battle map deliberately leaves these out (each has a documented stand-in today):

- **A map band on the phone's Story tab**, so you can read, move and type without switching tabs.
- **Drag-to-move and waypoints** for the player (the engine already supports `via`).
- **Squeezing** through narrow openings, **raised floors, stairs and climbing** terrain, **doors that open during
  movement**, and **hidden terrain** (secret doors, concealed pits).
- **Movement traits** (Flyby, Swarm, Incorporeal Movement and the like), **grappled dragging**, **mounted combat**.
- **Light and vision**: darkvision, dim light and fog of war on the map.
- **Background art** for maps and **hex grids**.
- **Companions the player moves** (today the DM moves allies).

## Structured imports follow-ups

The first version of structured imports deliberately leaves these out:

- **Cheaper bulk reading**: the Message Batches API (half price, asynchronous), several entries per request, and an
  exact token count before a job starts.
- **Finding what detection missed**: a Claude pass over entries the offline detector didn't recognize (today,
  "Structure as…" on the book page).
- **Editing a book's text** in the app, and re-importing a new copy of a book while keeping review decisions.
- **Per-campaign book selection** (today every switched-on book applies to every campaign).
- **Item mechanics**: a magic weapon's +N on attacks, charges, spell attack and save DC bonuses from items, and
  enforcing attunement limits.
- **Monster detail**: structured actions and legendary actions, and senses on the battle map (the DM reads them from
  the text today).
